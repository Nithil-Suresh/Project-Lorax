# Lorax
## A simple app for reporting environmental harm

Large organizations, like businesses, schools, and manufacturers, have a much larger impact on the environment than any one individual. It's important that we hold these organizations accountable for their treatment of the environment.

Like "The Lorax" from Dr. Seuss' book, the Lorax app keeps organizations accountable. Prioritizing simplicity and efficiency, Lorax enables users to file a detailed anonymous report within mere minutes, which is then processed and handled accordingly by our site admins.
 
Maybe you work at a restaurant and see them excessively wasting food, or you’re a university student and notice that unused classrooms keep their lights on 24/7, or you work for a real estate firm and you’re concerned with their lack of care for the ecosystems surrounding a new residential development. No matter your concern, Lorax makes it easy to report.

Users are also able to create Lorax accounts, or sign in with Google accounts, to save their reports and receive updates from site admins when their reports are handled.

*Don't be afraid to speak for the trees!*
