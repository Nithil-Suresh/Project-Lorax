# Lorax
## A simple app for reporting environmental harm

Large organizations, like businesses, schools, and manufacturers, have a much larger impact on the environment than any one individual. It's important that we hold these organizations accountable for their treatment of the environment.

Like "The Lorax" from Dr. Seuss' book, the Lorax app keeps organizations accountable. Prioritizing simplicity and efficiency, Lorax enables users to file a detailed anonymous report within mere minutes, which is then processed and handled accordingly by our site admins.
 
Maybe you work at a restaurant and see them excessively wasting food, or you’re a university student and notice that unused classrooms keep their lights on 24/7, or you work for a real estate firm and you’re concerned with their lack of care for the ecosystems surrounding a new residential development. No matter your concern, Lorax makes it easy to report.

Users are also able to create Lorax accounts, or sign in with Google accounts, to save their reports and receive updates from site admins when their reports are handled.

*Don't be afraid to speak for the trees!*

## My role as the team's Software Architect 
This was a semester long project, which took months to learn new tools, figure out a working schedule for the team, and get the project functioning. Here we look at my specific contributions to the team and the project. At the beginning of the project, I helped the team come up with the idea for the app. A whistleblower app where users can anonymously report environmental concerns from their company, university, club etc. After agreeing on this idea, the team moved on to requirements elicitation to see what our stakeholders were looking for in our app. I interviewed students at my university and asked people to fill out questionnaires that would help us better understand what the people wanted. 

Following requirements elicitation, work on the project finally commenced. Our project was hosted on Heroku and I played a role in configuring our settings.py file so that it could work with the guidelines set up by Heroku. In the next sprint, I was tasked with setting up an Amazon S3 bucket so that we could store our files there. I created an AWS account and made a IAM user and completed all the necessary configurations for setting up a bucket. Following the completion of this task, users were now able to submit files along with their report and view them after submission. 

I also contributed to functionality features of our project. I worked on all three layers of our 3-tier project, including the ReportedIssue model in our models.py file, the views, and the HTML templates. I also worked on front end features including buttons, the footer, and cleaning up the usability of the Google login feature. 

As a team member, I was very communicative with my team. I was always planning out when our next team meeting should be, what we had to get done, and when we had to finish our tasks. I ensured that our team met all of our project requirements and made sure we were on pace to finish well in advance. I also made myself as someone my team members could contact and get help relatively quickly no matter what part of the project they were working on. As the project went on, I became closer to my team mates. I started working on the project with random people but I finished the project with good friends.
